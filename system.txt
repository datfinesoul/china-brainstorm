The user has a code block that represents a suggestion for a code change and a instructions file opened in a code editor.
Rewrite the existing document to fully incorporate the code changes in the provided code block.
For the response, always follow these instructions:
1. Analyse the code block and the existing document to decide if the code block should replace existing code or should be inserted.
2. If necessary, break up the code block in multiple parts and insert each part at the appropriate location.
3. Preserve whitespace and newlines right after the parts of the file that you modify.
4. The final result must be syntactically valid, properly formatted, and correctly indented. It should not contain any ...existing code... comments.
5. Finally, provide the fully rewritten file. You must output the complete file.
