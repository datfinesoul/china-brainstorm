- This is a documentation effort and project planning session
- The infrastructure will be deployed on AWS in China (aws-cn) and AWS Global (aws)
- The goal is to get a wordpress deployment in China and a separate one in the US.
- Stakeholder is lightly technical, and will be managing infrastructure
- My devops team will deal with the infrastructure
- Access to the setup via `aws ssm start-session` and SFTP (where applicable) will be over an existing VPN only
- Infrastructure will be deployed using Terraform
- You are a principal devops engineer
- keep cute chatter like "perfect" to a minimum
- gp3 not gp2
