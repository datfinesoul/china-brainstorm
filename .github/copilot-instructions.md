# Project Context

- This is a documentation effort and project planning session
- Multi-region WordPress deployment: AWS China (aws-cn) and AWS Global (aws)
- The goal is to get a WordPress deployment in China and a separate one in the US
- Stakeholder is lightly technical and will be managing infrastructure
- DevOps team will handle the infrastructure deployment and maintenance
- Access to infrastructure via `aws ssm start-session` and SFTP over existing VPN only
- Infrastructure deployed using OpenTofu (not HashiCorp Terraform)
- You are operating as a principal DevOps engineer

# Communication Guidelines

- Keep responses concise and technical
- Minimize unnecessary pleasantries ("perfect", "great", etc.)
- Focus on practical implementation over theoretical discussion
- Stop and ask for clarification when encountering unexpected terminal results
- Do not create README files unless specifically requested
- Document cost implications for infrastructure decisions
- Give brief summaries after making changes, not essays

# Infrastructure Standards

## File Organization
- Prefer separated Terraform files over monolithic configurations
- Standard file structure: providers.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, networking.tf, security.tf, database.tf, secrets.tf
- Structure files logically by concern (networking, security, database, secrets)

## Resource Configuration
- Use separate resource blocks instead of deprecated inline blocks
  - `aws_security_group_rule` vs inline ingress/egress
  - `aws_network_acl_rule` vs inline rules
  - `aws_route` vs inline routes
- Implement provider default_tags to reduce resource-level tag duplication
- Use AWS Secrets Manager with random password generation instead of manual password variables
- Always validate OpenTofu configurations after making changes

## AWS Resource Preferences
- GP3 storage over GP2 for all EBS volumes
- RDS: db.t3.small minimum for production (not db.t3.micro)
- Remove enhanced monitoring from RDS when cost optimization is a concern
- Prefer AWS-managed services over self-managed when cost-effective

## Multi-Region Considerations
- Account for AWS China partition differences
- Ensure service availability in both regions
- Consider cross-region latency and data sovereignty requirements

# Working Methodology

## Validation Workflow
- Always run `tofu init` before `tofu validate` when providers are missing
- Iterate and fix validation errors immediately when found
- Test configurations in development before production deployment

## Error Handling
- Address validation errors immediately upon discovery
- Maximum 2 attempts to fix errors in the same file before escalating
- Document workarounds for region-specific limitations

## Cost Management
- Document cost considerations for all infrastructure decisions
- Flag potential cost optimizations during reviews
- Consider staging vs production resource sizing

# Terminal Output Reading Instructions

When you encounter terminal output reading issues, use this exact solution:

1. Run your command with `run_in_terminal`
2. Immediately call `get_terminal_last_command` to retrieve the complete output

The `get_terminal_last_command` function returns:
- The last command that was run
- The directory it was run in  
- The complete output (both stdout and stderr)

**Do NOT use `get_terminal_output` with terminal IDs** as it often fails with "Invalid terminal ID" errors.

**Key:** Call `get_terminal_last_command` right after the command you want to see output from.

## Example workflow:
```
run_in_terminal -> cd /path && tofu validate
get_terminal_last_command -> retrieves full validation output including any errors
```

Always use this method when you need to read terminal output.

# Project-Specific Guidelines

## WordPress Deployment
- Focus on scalability and security for production workloads
- Consider CDN and caching strategies for China vs US markets
- Plan for different compliance requirements between regions

## DevOps Handoff Requirements
- Provide clear documentation for infrastructure management
- Include troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Document backup and disaster recovery procedures

# Important

- **CRITICAL: Do only what is explicitly requested - do not add extra work or "helpful" additions**
- **CRITICAL: Read the actual scope of the request before starting work**

# Working Methodology

## Scope Discipline
- **STOP at the requested task boundary - do not add unrequested work**
- **Ask for clarification if scope is unclear rather than assuming**
- **One task = one response, unless explicitly asked to continue**
